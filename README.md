# Tib's Finite State Machine in Godot 4+

**A simple and flexible finite state machine implementation for Godot game projects using the .NET version, written entirely in C#**

It's based on the state machine made by [YourGeekEric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfp7FIO4GTA), but with several modifications and some newly added features.
It also ditched the use of Godot Signals in favour of C# events.
